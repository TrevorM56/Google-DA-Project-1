# Google Data Analytics Case Study #1 with Pyhton.
## Overview: _How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?_
  This analysis is case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course through Coursera. This data analysis slates the individual as a junior data analystic working for a fictional bike-share company named Cyclistic. This project had the analyst review up-to a year's worth of data collected from the bike-share program. The primary goal of this analysis is to find the differences between how members and casual users of the service use the bike-share program differently. From this, the analyst is tasked with reviewing the realtionships and providing three recomendations to key stakeholders for increasing the amount of individuals that become members of the bike-share program.

  ## Project Structure:
  This project has been split into different files that will show different aspects of the case study. There is a file for the full case study, a file for the code, a file for the markdown, and a file for the guided questions. This project also has a file for the PowerPoint presentation of the analysis.
